The listed algorithms can be used to prune exceptionally long branches in phylogenetic trees. 

- **Primitive Straight-Forward Approach (PSFA)**
    - 

- **Circular Pruning Algorithm (CPA)**
    - 

- **CPA + PSFA**
    - 

- **PSFA + CPA + PFSA**
    - 


## Usage

The New_Algorithms.ipynb file consists of five cells. The first just installs the ete3 package. The other cells are used to run four different variants of the above described algorithms.

In each cell, the usage of the specific algorithm is described in comments. 



#### Publications

The algorithms are yet to be published.
